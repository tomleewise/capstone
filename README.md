Motivation-

As a musician and as a lover of music in general, I've always been fascinated with music composition. After noticing that many songs share similar sounds and structures, I began to think about the formula for writing a hit song. Using Spotify's audio features I set out to see if the top selling singles followed a formula that would lead to their success. 

Data Question-

What are the key features that successful singles share?

Findings-

-In the key of C# Major
-4/4 time signature
-Keep it mid-tempo, 119 to 140 bpm
-Make the song danceable and high energy
-Not too loud
-Lean more toward electronic instrumentation but not all the way

Challenges-

Using Spotify's API to pull the audio features from the given tracks. Cleaning the data to make the features makes sense for visualizations.
